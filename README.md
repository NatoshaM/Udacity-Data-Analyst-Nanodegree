**Data-Analyst-Nanodegree**

***
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree teaches you how to to clean up messy data, uncover patterns and insights, and communicate your findings. You'll start with an introduction to data analysis tools, including Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. Using these tools, you will ask questions about data and answer them through data collection, exploration, wrangling, and visualization. This intermediate-level program includes real-world projects where you will choose your own datasets, research questions, and analysis approach. As you progress through the program, each course will repeat the data analysis process while introducing
more advanced techniques, such as applying data imputation to fill in missing data and applying appropriate encodings when developing data visualizations.  (DAND) course repository included projects on Medical No shows prediction, Regression, Hypothesis test , A/B test, Data Wrangling(gather, assess, clean), and Data Visualization.

Analysing more than 10,000 TMDb movies and getting the answers to: 

What are the top 10 favorite movies? 

What year was the highest budget movie produce? 

What is the correlation between the average runtime of movies and the passage of time?

[**Project 2: Analyze A/B Test Results**](https://github.com/NatoshaM/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Project%202_%20AB%20Testing/Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook_new.ipynb)

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to  help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

[**Project 4: Data Wrangling**](https://github.com/NatoshaM/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Project%204_Data%20Wrangling/Data_Wrangling_Project_Template.ipynb)

In this project, you will apply the skills you acquired in the course to gather and wrangle real-world data with two datasets of your choice.

You will retrieve and extract the data, assess the data programmatically and visually, accross elements of data quality and structure, and implement a cleaning strategy for the data. You will then store the updated data into your selected database/data store, combine the data, and answer a research question with the datasets.

**Project 6: Data Visualizations using Tableau**

The goal in this project is to create visualizations and Dashboards in Tableau to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
