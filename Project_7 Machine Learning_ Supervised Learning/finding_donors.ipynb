    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like.

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following models are what I think are appropriate for this problem that I will test on the census data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Logistic Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world application: Used in credit scoring to determine the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan.\n",
    " \n",
    "   Strengths:\n",
    "   * Simple and interpretable.\n",
    "   * Works well for binary classification problems.\n",
    "   * Outputs probabilities, which can be useful for ranking or threshold-based decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Weaknesses:\n",
    "   * Assumes a linear relationship between features and the target.\n",
    "   * May underperform with complex relationships or highly imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this model: Given the problem is binary classification (income > $50k or not), Logistic Regression provides a clear, interpretable model with reasonable performance. Additionally, it is computationally efficient on datasets with many features, like ours.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "**2. Ensemble Method-AdaBoost**\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world application: Commonly used in fraud detection for financial transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Strengths:\n",
    "   * Can handle large datasets and multiple feature types (categorical, continuous).\n",
    "Reduces overfitting through bagging (averaging predictions of multiple trees).\n",
    "Provides feature importance rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Weaknesses:\n",
    "   * Can be computationally intensive due to training multiple trees.\n",
    "   * May require tuning  to achieve optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this model: Random Forest is robust and handles high-dimensional data well, which aligns with our dataset containing 103 features. It’s less prone to overfitting and can manage complex, nonlinear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Support Vector Machines**\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world application: Used in image classification, such as handwriting recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Strengths:\n",
    "   * Effective in high-dimensional spaces and works well for datasets with a clear margin of separation.\n",
    "   * Offers flexibility with kernal functions to capture non-linear relationships\n",
    "    \n",
    "Weakness:\n",
    "* Computationally expensive, especially with large datasets.\n",
    "* Sensitive to parameter choices and scaling of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this model: SVM can be beneficial for datasets like ours, where complex decision boundaries might exist. Its ability to leverage kernel functions makes it a strong candidate for improving classification performance, especially when precision is emphasized."

    "Based on the evaluation, the AdaBoost model demonstrates the highest F-score on the testing set when using 100% of the training data, outperforming both Logistic Regression and SVC. Although the differences in F-scores among the three models are relatively small, AdaBoost provides a slight edge in predictive performance. This model maintains consistent performance regardless of whether 100% or 10% of the training data is used, highlighting its robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, AdaBoost offers efficient training and prediction times, both of which are faster than SVC and comparable to Logistic Regression. Given its superior F-score, which reflects a balance between precision and recall, and its computational efficiency, AdaBoost is the most suitable choice for identifying individuals earning more than $50,000. This model ensures both accuracy and speed, making it an ideal candidate for CharityML’s needs.\n"

    "AdaBoost is an example of ensemble learning, which means it combines the strengths of several simple models (called \"weak learners\") to create a more accurate and reliable final model. Think of it like assembling a panel of experts, each focusing on different aspects of a problem. On their own, these experts might make mistakes, but together, their combined input leads to better decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how it works: AdaBoost starts by training a weak learner, which could be a simple decision tree. After this initial training, it looks at the mistakes the model made and gives more weight to those misclassified examples, essentially telling the next weak learner, “Pay extra attention to these tricky cases.” This process continues for several rounds, each time focusing more on the errors from the previous step. Once all the weak learners have been trained, AdaBoost combines their predictions to make a final decision, using a kind of weighted voting system where more accurate learners get a stronger say. This allows the model to improve its performance significantly, even when individual learners are only slightly better than random guessing."

    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

The accuracy dropped from 0.8676 to 0.8433, while the F-score decreased from 0.7448 to 0.7053. Although the performance declined marginally, the reduced feature set still provides reasonably good predictive power. If training time or computational resources were a concern, using the reduced dataset could be a viable option. With fewer features, the model is likely to train and predict faster, requiring less computational power while maintaining acceptable performance levels. Ultimately, the decision to use the reduced feature set depends on the specific needs of the project. If real-time predictions or limited resources are priorities, the reduced dataset may be preferred. However, if maximizing predictive accuracy is crucial, the full dataset would be more appropriate.\n"
